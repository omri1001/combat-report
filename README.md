## ðŸŽ¯ About the Project

This project automates the creation of **IDF-style training reports** through a Telegram interface. It enables users (trainers, officers, analysts) to:

- Input free-text training data via chat
- Enrich and format it using **GPT-4o-mini**
- Generate a clean, organized **Word report**
- Include dynamic **charts, grades, summaries**, and **multimedia links**

Built for **Digital Combat Academy (DCA)**, this tool streamlines the after-action review process into a simple and interactive workflow.
